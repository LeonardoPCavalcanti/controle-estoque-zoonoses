/**
 * Find the package.json file, either from a TypeScript file somewhere not
 * in a 'dist' folder, or a built and/or installed 'dist' folder.
 *
 * Note: this *only* works if you build your code into `'./dist'`, and that the
 * source path does not also contain `'dist'`! If you don't build into
 * `'./dist'`, or if you have files at `./src/dist/dist.ts`, then this will
 * not work properly!
 *
 * The default `pathFromSrc` option assumes that the calling code lives one
 * folder below the root of the package. Otherwise, it must be specified.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // src/index.ts
 * import { findPackageJson } from 'package-json-from-dist'
 *
 * const pj = findPackageJson(import.meta.url)
 * console.log(`package.json found at ${pj}`)
 * ```
 *
 * If the caller is deeper within the project source, then you must provide
 * the appropriate fallback path:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // src/components/something.ts
 * import { findPackageJson } from 'package-json-from-dist'
 *
 * const pj = findPackageJson(import.meta.url, '../../package.json')
 * console.log(`package.json found at ${pj}`)
 * ```
 *
 * When running from CommmonJS, use `__filename` instead of `import.meta.url`
 *
 * ```ts
 * // src/index.cts
 * import { findPackageJson } from 'package-json-from-dist'
 *
 * const pj = findPackageJson(__filename)
 * console.log(`package.json found at ${pj}`)
 * ```
